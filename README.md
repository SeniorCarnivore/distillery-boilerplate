#Distillery React

#Motivation

At this moment we have many react developers working in our company. Everyone has their knowledge, experience and tastes. We decided to combine all the good parts together and to write them down. So, this is recomended boilerplate for our React projects, which is trying to be  bleeding edge.

#Features

* It was bootstrapped with Facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* It supports all new ES features.
* We recomend to install [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) plugin to your editor. It'll display linting warnings directly in your code.
* For requests we use awesome promise based HTTP client [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).
* As for styles, we use [ðŸ’…styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).

#Fast start

*To start your project install npm packages `npm i`.
*Then run `npm start`, it'll start server on http://localhost:3000/ and open a new tab in your browser.
